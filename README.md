# Bailey's SVG Logo Maker

## Description
This CLI application allows the user to create a scalable vector graphic using the terminal and guided questions. The project is composed of JavaScript and Node.js packages and requires inquirer node library package along with Jest to test the application. Once the user installs node, and requires inquirer, the user can use the CLI command node index.js to be prompted through a series of questions, which will then generate a 300x200px SVG file, determining the logo's shape, color, text and text color. Once the user has completed the questions a SVG file can be viewed using a browser.
